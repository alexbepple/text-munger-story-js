# What is this?

This is an example for teaching how to develop a simple story using TDD.

The tags of this repo contain different stages of the example. _master_ is most likely not where you want to start.

* [_alpha_](https://github.com/alexbepple/text-munger-story-js/tree/alpha) contains the initial situation. The UI has been sketched out, but nothing else.
* [_beta_](https://github.com/alexbepple/text-munger-story-js/tree/beta) is a functional state.
* In [_gamma_](https://github.com/alexbepple/text-munger-story-js/tree/gamma) the example has been extended to include more UI interactions.

You can get at the tags using `git checkout <tag>`.
